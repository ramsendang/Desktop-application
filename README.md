# TaskManagerDesktopApplication
This is a GUI based Task Manager app build for Software Development Module in MSc. Computer Science at The University of Law. 

To build this desktop GUI application I am going to use Tkinter library. tkinter library is already available when installing python by default so we not need to install it seperately. I will also use ttkbootstrap to create the GUI (Graphical User Interface) to use ttkbootstrap we need to install it seperately.
